### Gains Watch

### What and why?

Gains Watch is a social media software that allows users to accurately track all things fitness related. This includes macros and nutrients, cataloging gym time, workouts completed, supplement checklist, sleep, etc. The software will serve as a social media platform where people can communicate, share their progress with other like-minded individuals, and allow for people to hold each other accountable in terms of gym progress by making their information visible to their peers (if they opt to!)

### For whom?

This software is intended to be used for all gym goers, physically motiviated people, those on a diet, or even just people who want to develop better sleeping habits.


### How?

Users can create their own user profiles where they can track their own statistics - this will serve as the base functionallity of the software. Users can opt into the social media aspect by adding friends, following leading influencers, and taking a part of the overall fitness community. 
Features include:
1. Create and edit profiles
2. Tracking for a multitude of statistics
3. Have a social media feed
4. Friend system
5. Allow users to interact (or choose not to) with each other, including DMs, blocking, liking, etc.


### Scope

The scope of this proposal is not easy, as it requires many different components with it being a social media platform. The trackers for individual profiles will likely not be difficult to implement, but making a system where multiple users can interact with each other may prove more challenging. However, the application is fairly straight forward.
